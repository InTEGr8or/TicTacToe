# TicTacToe
JavaScript based player vs. computer version of Tic-Tac-Toe. Currently some jQuery, but handlers will be removed in place of pure JavaScript.

I chose to begin building this in Javascript, with the intention of learning JS fundamentals. The Board is rendered using a two dimensional array that uses a row and column number [0-2]. My intention is to be able to scale this project up to build a game like Battleship, or any other type of tile based onClick games.

I've removed much of the repitition from earlier commits. The intent is to write the code sloppy but working, then refactor the working project using high order functions: callbacks, closures, recursion -- where appropriate.
