# TicTacToe
JavaScript based player vs. computer version of Tic-Tac-Toe. Currently some jQuery, but handlers will be removed in place of pure JavaScript.

This is just a basic project that I chose to begin building in Javascript, with the intention of learning JS fundamentals.
My intention is to be able to scale this project up to build a game like Battleship, or any other type of tile based onClick games.

Currently if you look at the code, you will see a lot of repetition, but this is my first pure javascript project. The intent is to write the code sloppy but working, then refactor the working project using high order functions: callbacks, closures, recursion -- where appropriate.
