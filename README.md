# TicTacToe
JavaScript based player vs. computer version of Tic-Tac-Toe. Currently some jQuery, but handlers will be removed in place of pure JavaScript.

This is just a basic project that I chose to begin building in Javascript, with the intention of learning JS fundamentals.
I might be able to scale this project up to build a game like Battleship, or any other type of tile based onClick games.
